# My-Internship-Project-Task-3
Completed the third week task for Expense tracking application of my MotionCut internship. During the third week of my MotionCut internship for the Expense tracking application, I successfully accomplished the following key tasks:

User Input and Expense Details: Implemented a user-friendly interface that allows users to input expense details, including the description, amount, and category. Categories such as transportation, entertainment, and food were integrated to help users categorize their expenses effectively.

Expense Calculation: Developed a robust calculation system that automatically calculates the total expenses based on user inputs. This ensures that users can easily track their spending and have a clear understanding of their financial situation.

Result Display: Created a feature that displays the calculated total expense to the user in a clear and easily understandable format.

Data Storage: Designed a mechanism to save the results of the expense tracking in a file, ensuring that users can access and reference their financial data in the future. This data storage functionality allows users to maintain a record of their spending history.
